## Comprehensive Optimization Analysis & Implementation Plan

### Latest Session - Codebase Review & Optimization Strategy

#### 🔍 Analysis Completed
- **Backend**: Comprehensive Django codebase analysis identifying performance bottlenecks
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript architecture review with optimization opportunities  
- **Database**: Query optimization and storage improvement recommendations
- **Code Quality**: Identified unused code, duplication, and refactoring opportunities

### 🎯 High Priority Optimizations Identified

#### Database & Backend Performance Issues
1. **Missing Database Indexes** (Critical):
   - Transaction queries: `date`, `user_id + date`, `account_id`, `category_id`, `amount`
   - Account/Category: `user_id + name` composite indexes  
   - Goal/GroupExpense: Status and user-based filtering indexes
   
2. **N+1 Query Problems**:
   - TransactionViewSet missing `select_related` for `transfer_account`, `suggested_category`
   - TagViewSet inefficient many-to-many traversal
   - Summary calculations using separate queries instead of aggregation

3. **File Upload Optimization**:
   - Synchronous processing causing timeouts on large files
   - No transaction batching for bulk inserts
   - Missing async processing with Celery/background tasks

#### Frontend Performance Issues  
1. **Bundle Size**: 842KB (too large) - needs code splitting
2. **Component Architecture**: Large monolithic components (TransactionTable 1000+ lines)
3. **State Management**: Over-fetching data, unnecessary re-renders, no caching
4. **Code Duplication**: Modal patterns, form validation, loading states repeated

#### Unused/Duplicate Code Identified
- **Backend**: `splitwise_views.py` unused imports, duplicate account lookup logic
- **Frontend**: `Groups.tsx` (placeholder), `EnhancedGroupExpenses.tsx` (duplicate)
- **Components**: EditableNumberCell unused, inconsistent error handling
